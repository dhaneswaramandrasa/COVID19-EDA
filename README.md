# COVID19-EDA
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global infectious disease outbreak caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus. The disease was originated in December of 2019 in Wuhan, the capital of China's Hubei province, and has since spread globally, resulting in the coronavirus pandemic with nearly 550,000 cases and around 25,000 deaths worldwide.  There are many questions on how this infectious disease spreads around the world. Is is true the disease spread slowly in high temperature? Why the mortality rate is so high in country like Italy? Is lockdown policy is enough to stop down the spreading of the virus?  However, what is the data suggest? Therefore, I will try to analyse and visualize the trend and answer those questions:    1. What is the global trend of the COVID-19 cases? Which countries suffer the most at the moment? 2. What is the impact of quarantine policy to the spreading of COVID-19 for each country? 3. What is the relationship between number of test to confirmed cases? 4. Which aspect of the country correlate most with COVID-19 cases and deaths? 5. What is the relationship between healthcare system of the country and COVID-19 cases andÂ deaths?
